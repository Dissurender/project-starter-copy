# project-starter-template
Guide to get any project off the ground quickly, in any language!

Fork, rename, and go through the [guide](./guide.md). 

Anything within squiggly brackets `{}` needs to be replaced with real content. 

Lists can have more items than stated, but I recommend keeping MVP as small as possible. Minimum, after all. 

Have fun, and tell me if you've used it!
