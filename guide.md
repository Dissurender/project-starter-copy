## Design Order
1. make multiple users, and how they use the app [^1]
1. think about data and how it relates to the app and user [^2]
1. create wireframes [^3]
1. browse inspiration online [^4]
1. move along in the design process to mockups and prototypes [^5]

**Octo's todo system**
_A kanban board, but within your todo list_

`[ ] do the thing` use in lists

`@status thing to check later` use in comments throughout your project 

```md
[ ] @todo
[?] @think
[o] @doing
[/] @block
  @block: _insert issue here_
[>] @hack
[!] @fixme
[x] @done
[-] @cancel
```

**Octo's recommended tools**
_these are the only ones I use when making things_

* [figma](https://figma.com) - wireframing and mockups
* [codepen](https://codepen.io) - small code and css sketches
* [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - writing code
