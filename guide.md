1. browse inspiration online [^4]
1. move along in the design process to mockups and prototypes [^5]

**Octo's todo system**
_A kanban board, but within your todo list_

`[ ] do the thing` use in lists

`@status thing to check later` use in comments throughout your project

```md
[ ] @todo
[?] @think
[o] @doing
[/] @block
@block: _insert issue here_
[>] @hack
[!] @fixme
[x] @done
[-] @cancel
```
